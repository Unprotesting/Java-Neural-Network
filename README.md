# Java-Neural-Network
## A neural network in Java from scratch without libraries or API's.

 #### Note: This is a template for other neural networks but standalone, it checks whether a float array is sorted ascendingly, descendingly or not at all.


 A result of 1, 0, 0 means the array the AI thinks the array is sorted ascendingly. 
 
 A result of 0, 1, 0 means the the AI thinks the array is sorted descendingly. 
 
 A result of 0, 0, 1 means the AI thinks the array is not sorted.
 
 A result of 0, 0, 0 means the AI does not know / an error.
