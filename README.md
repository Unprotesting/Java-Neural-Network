# Java-Neural-Network
 A neural network in Java from scratch without libraries or API's.

 Note: This is a template for other neural networks but standalone checks whether a float array is sorted ascendingly, descendingly or not at all.


 A result of 0, 0 means the array the AI thinks the array sorted descendingly. 
 A result of 1, 0 means the the AI thinks the array sorted ascendingly. 
 A result of 0, 1 means the AI thinks the array not sorted.
 A result of 1, 1 means the AI does not know / an error.
